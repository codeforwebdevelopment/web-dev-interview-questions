A Design System is the single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product. So a Design System is not a deliverable, but a set of deliverables. It will evolve constantly with the product, the tools and the new technologies

Understanding web App Design: Mapping User Experience - Data Flow Diagram with Examples- prototypes- steps - new startup idea

To put the idea into reality by making a website it is not that easy that you start to code directly.

There are multiple things that you have to plan-
How it looks at the phone and web. All things need to be defined.
user journey map, wireframes, clickable prototype, and visual design this is the process that you must have to follow.
well designed UI and UX are very important. (UX is how the app works and UI is how it looks.)
The flawless app creates a positive impression on the user.
Start with making a list of screens by understanding your users.
Draw a rough chart - flow map that will help.
1- map includes visualization of user flow.
2- wireframes- visual concepts.
3- prototype- is a dynamic model.
4- visual design- mockups and animations.

Try to make flow like this after all design-
Flow web app
1. The user reaches the site
a. If already registered logs in
b. If not, offer registration through
i. Google
ii. Facebook
iii. LinkedIn
iv. Email
2. User can do either of the following
a. Browse existing content
i. Expand to see the additional response
ii. Comment on it
iii. Upvote (Exact text to be decided later)
iv. Downvote (Exact text to be decided later)
v. Higher, the upvote higher up the display of the particular feedback/response
b. Create new content
i. Create a new Query (exact text to be decided later) can be a link or text
1. If Link, then the content of the link should be shown in a scrollable area without impacting the overall experience of the page
2. If text show text in the scrollable area
3. Classify the query into one of the defined subject or allow to select others with the ability to define a new subject; with time the new subjects, if relevant should be added to define subject list; the defined subject should be auto recommended when typing
ii. Create a new response to an existing query
c. Change their preferences
i. Type of subject they are interested in
1. If nothing is selected, everything is shown
2. Even if something is selected, other topics related to the subject are also shown
3. If there is no content on the subject they have selected then content related to other subjects are shown
ii. Change profile information
iii. Change password
3. Others
a. The application will be optimized for all existing browsers and should display well on desktops, tablets and mobile
b. Only registered users can expand on the topics to see the full content others may see the first few lines and responses
c. Search engines get to see the content but once the user lands on the page they see only the partial content as mentioned above unless the user is already registered
d. Side scroll should be shown with other queries related to the subject
e. Each new query should be classified into a category as chosen by the user
f. This should be a single page application with the feed continuously updated with what is relevant to the user
g. User can create anonymously content (queries/responses)
h. Created content should be optimized for Search Engines to find
i. Optimal usage of processing power and storage would be key

figma, adobe xd

https://sketch.io/sketchpad/

best prototyping design tool Figma.It is quickly becoming a great option with popular apps such as Sketch and Adobe Experience Design (XD). Designing interfaces are one of its many features. In past, The sketch has been the application of choice for many UX and UI designers but now it’s figma. Basically, it is used to make a UI  blueprint.
Features of figma-

All of the standard keyboard shortcuts that you expect to be present in a UI design tool are available in this tool. It is an entirely web-based & very powerful tool. It's free for individual use.It allows both UI & Prototyping, instead of just design.It also offers a downloadable native desktop app. It is developed using Electron(typically used for desktop apps).Here I am going to give an overview of the figma app. In this app, there is a layers panel on the left, the canvas in the middle, the properties panel on the right and the Tools toolbar at the top. Here we are working on frames. Artboards in figma called frames. This app allows you to use grids and column layouts inside artboards.In this, you use symbols which are called components. It also gives you the ability to Modify Shapes. You can import SVG's & animations on design. After completion of the design on the frame, you can make a prototype of it.Mainly you can do these things with this tool such as horizontal and vertical scrolling, wireframing, overlays, device frames and scrolling, prototyping and transitions, creating icons etc.

Comparison between Figma and Adobe XD

In figma, there is not any plugin to populate data. you have to manually write the data for that. while In the Adobe XD it takes a lead with a much more capable API that lets you pull live data, not just static data. There is some lack of plugins in figma while Adobe XD has lots of plugins.Figma, it has a great feature in that it has a centralized library means multiple people can work on it. If someone adds something then it shows the notification to all.Figma's implementation is good when it comes to sharing and gathering feedback. Many users can work on the same document at the same time. Figma is better for UI design mock-ups.

Figma is better than Adobe XD because its pages and artboards are nested and they are more flexible.
